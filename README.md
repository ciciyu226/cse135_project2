# Online Shopping Application
Author: Xi Yu, Davis Cho
        
Tools Used: JSP, jQuery, PostgreSQL, ER Model, Ajax, TomCat9.0.

This project is a clone of an online shopping website that implements basic functionalities in terms of product selling, buying, categorizing, searching, sales analysis, and  product recommendation system.

This repo is part 2 of the two-part shopping app project. This second part mainly handles sales analysis and product recommendation. As of part 2, the website is able to generate sales report based on multiple sorting filters(alphabetical, top-k sales). Also, it gives recommendations to vendors about what product would most likely to be bought when the other is bought (a correlational analysis).
